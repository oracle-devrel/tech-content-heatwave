## This repository demonstrates how to use HeatWave GenAI to build a Healthcare question-and-answer tool quickly and efficiently. With just a few steps, you can leverage HeatWave GenAI to create a tool for answering health-related questions based on custom documents.

## Introduction
HeatWave GenAI allows you to perform natural language queries on unstructured data using a familiar SQL interface. This capability streamlines tasks such as content generation, summarization, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It supports seamless one-step searches using in-database or external LLMs, with all components optimized for integration with proprietary data.
In this repository, we focus on using HeatWave GenAI to create a healthcare tool that answers questions based on documents ingested into the HeatWave vector store. For more information about HeatWave GenAI, visit the [official documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/heatwave/en/mys-hw-genai-overview.html).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**HeatWave-Enabled Database System**: Ensure you have a database system with HeatWave enabled. Refer to the [Getting Started with MySQL HeatWave on OCI]( https://www.oracle.com/developer/getting-started-with-mysql-heatwave-on-oci/) guide for setup instructions.

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oracle-devrel/tech-content-heatwave.git
   cd tech-content-heatwave/healthcare
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Create and activate a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - Install the required packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Upload Healthcare Documents**:
   - Upload your healthcare documents to the HeatWave vector store. Follow the instructions in the [Managing Objects](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/managingobjects_topic-To_upload_objects_to_a_bucket.htm) guide. You will perhaps need to [create PAR links](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingpreauthenticatedrequests_topic-To_create_a_preauthenticated_request_for_all_objects_in_a_bucket.htm) for you objects in the object store.
   - Sample documents are provided in the `healthcare_docs` folder. These documents are open-access papers from [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), but you can upload your own custom documents.

4. **Create a Vector Store**:
   - Create a vector store containing embeddings of your document data. Refer to the [HeatWave GenAI Vector Store](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/heatwave/en/mys-hw-genai-vector-store-load.html) guide for detailed instructions.

5. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Connect to the DB system:

   ``` bash
    mysql -h your_host_name -u yourusername -p
    ```

   - Implement the required stored procedures in your database system by installing the `hw_healthcare.sql` file.
   **IMPORTANT**:  Ensure that the correct vector store database and table names are used in the `hw_healthcare` procedure so that your vector store is utilized. Once updated the vector table names, source the `hw_healthcare.sql` file to install the stored procedures:

   ```source hw_healthcare.sql;```

6. **Configure Database Access**:
   - Update the `mysql_helper.py` file with your DB system's user credentials and password. This file is used to connect to the database and execute queries.

7. **Run the Application**:
     ```bash
     streamlit run heatwave_healthcare.py
     ```
