Welcome to the MySQL HeatWave E-Commerce Demo

This demo will showcase two common scenarios:
* An automatically generated product review summary 
* And natural language translations of product descriptions

All implemented entirely in the database via GenAI 

The demo consists of a typical e-commerce site with a full suite of data in the form of a product catalog, customers and product reviews.  

The site itself is built via a classic 3-tier architecture.  

It uses a web front-end that talks to a REST middleware layer and behind all that is the MySQL HeatWave database with GenAI.

Let’s dismiss this intro screen so we can see the full site.  As you can see here there’s a variety of products 

Let’s select the T-shirt.

— 

This is the t-shirt product page.

We see the product description to the right, and loading in realtime underneath that is the product review summary generated by HeatWave GenAI.  Since we’re using only the database to read the reviews and produce a summary it was a simple as writing a SQL Query!

Let’s quickly view the reviews that made up the summary…

Ok - so we said we’d see natural language translations.  

Let’s go to the language selector for this site and select Spanish.

Now we see the product page updated to show our product description in Spanish! 

This time generating the review summary is taking longer, because not only are we generating the summary, but we’re also translating it into the target language of Spanish. All in realtime.  

And there you go.  An E-commerce site powered entirely by HeatWave GenAI.

Pretty cool!
